## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/jrajala.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> I am a MA student in Phonetics and Language Technology with a background in Linguistics and Language Pedagogy. During the past 5 years as an English and French teacher, I have acquired valuable skills in planning, scheduling, evaluation and presentation. I have been described as a social, hard-working and development-oriented coworker that quickly adapts into a new team and workplace.

My cross-disciplinary backgound also includes a MA degree in Political Science with professional experience in the Learning and Development section of an international organisation.
