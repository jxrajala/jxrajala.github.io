## Introduction

<img src="assets/images/me.jpg" alt="Photo" hspace="20" width="30%" align="right"/> I am an MA student in Phonetics and Language Technology with a background in Linguistics and Foreign Language Teaching. The previous five years as an English And French teacher have given me valuable skills in planning, scheduling, presentation and cooperation. I have been characterised as a socially skillful colleague that quickly becomes a development-oriented member of a team.
